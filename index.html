            <h2>Why Kyoto?</h2>
            <h3>Kyoto the city of the Geisha</h3>
            <p>
              When you visit Kyoto, you're signing up for a unique experience,
              one that's a tad bit different from what other travelers often
              chase. Imagine this: One day, you're walking in a quiet
              neighborhood, enveloped in the scent of cherry blossoms, and the
              next, you're joining locals in a lively festival dance. Kyoto is
              the heart of Japan‚Äôs geisha world. In Kyoto, however,
              fully-fledged geisha are properly called geiko (pronounced
              ‚Äúgay-ko‚Äù). Young ladies, usually between the ages of 15 and 20,
              train for five years to become a geiko. During this period, they
              are known as maiko (pronounced ‚Äúmy-ko‚Äù). Knowledgeable insiders
              estimate that there are about 100 geiko and 100 maiko in Kyoto.
              Other cities, like Tokyo, have some version of geisha, but they
              don‚Äôt usually undergo the strict training that defines Kyoto‚Äôs
              maiko and geiko. Geisha are highly skilled entertainers who appear
              at high-end dinners, private parties and special events to add a
              special touch to the proceedings. They are NOT prostitutes,
              despite various silly rumors and portrayals in certain books and
              movies. Rather, they are ladies who have trained for years in the
              traditional Japanese arts to become the perfect entertainers.

                  Such a beautiful coffee shop with phenomenal staff and warm
